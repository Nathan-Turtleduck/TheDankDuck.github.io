## Welcome to my GitHub Page

I'm still learning how to use this page and maintain it. But, if we're not learning, *then what are we doing?*

### About Me

**Short Auto-Bio**
I've been coding for about 2 years now. I never did any CS stuff at all until my first year of college. So far I am loving the CS program, but more importantly **I love coding.**
After college is over, I would love to work for a game company or start my own indie game company (Likely while I'm working as a Computer Scientist for some corporation)

I'm so excited to see what the future has in store for me.
